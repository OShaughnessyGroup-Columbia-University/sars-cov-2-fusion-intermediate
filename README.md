# sars-cov-2 fusion intermediate simulations

This repository contains codes for running and analyzing sars-cov-2 fusion intermediate simulations, supporting findings in the paper "Host cell membrane capture by the SARS CoV-2  
spike protein fusion intermediate" available on bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.439051v3). 

A full record of the study (including simulation trajectories) can be found at Zenodo via https://zenodo.org/record/7487128#.Y6snOS2B2MI.
